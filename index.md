My name is Tina. I'm an artist, designer, technologist and educator, with a special interest in social justice and technology, privacy and surveillance, intersectionality, inclusion and playfulness as a learning tool. I am based in Montreal, though sometimes you can find me in Toronto or Beirut.

I tweet from time to time [@troiska](https://twitter.com/troiska).
